========================== README RUBYBASICS ====================================
This is a collection of simple ruby scripts used for teaching programming to students who are learning to program.
I tend to walk through them and discuss the points of interest and then run them as demos in class to show what happens with variations of the program.

This is used with parts of the Ruby and Rails classes, which a colleague and I teach.
The practicals used are available here, http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/b.scharlau/pages/teaching/CS5550/practicals/practicals/

The lesson plan that we used to use was this, although we now have now reduced this in 
favour of using Sinatra sooner in the lessons:

Lesson 1: introduction to course - no code samples - so no 01 folder
Lesson 2: ruby 1 
Lesson 3: ruby 2
Lesson 4: flow and methods
Lesson 5: arrays and ranges
Lesson 6: methods and applications
Lesson 7: symbols
Lesson 8: classes
Lesson 9: files and tests
Lesson 10: modules, blocks and procs

Each folder will have a few 'run as they are' files, plus one <name>_spec.rb file which will need to have a similar <name>.rb file
created to make the spec file pass all of its tests. This will be the 'larger' program that is needed to be written to see how the
ideas fit into practice.

Our goal was to always bring in tests sooner through use of test-first approach promoted by
http://testfirst.org as a way to know that the program is running correctly. I will do a few without tests to show how you get output
to the screen and all, but then move quickly to a learn with tests approach. This will not be test driven development, but rather use
tests to know that the program works as expected. It will set them up fine therefore to move to test driven development later in the
following term.

Feel free to use these materials yourself, just please let me know how you get on with them and we can all move forward with this.
