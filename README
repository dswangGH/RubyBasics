========================== README RUBYBASICS ====================================
This is a collection of simple ruby scripts used for teaching programming to students who are learning to program. I tend to walk through them and discuss the points of interest and then run them as demos in class to show what happens with variations of the program.

This is used for the course at http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~csc280/teaching/CS1514/ where I teach the ruby lectures and a colleague does the rails ones. The practicals used are available here, http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~csc228/teaching/CS5550/practicals/ Do note the lectures are restricted, and I'll move their material to a non-restricted site shortly.
